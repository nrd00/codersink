    description:
      "Building a modern web application involves more than creating reusable components. Next.js App Router introduces a server-first approach that changes how developers fetch data, organize routes, handle mutations, and deliver fast user experiences. In this guide, we explore Server Components, Server Actions, and practical architectural decisions for building maintainable applications.",
